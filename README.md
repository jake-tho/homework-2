# homework-2 Jake Thomason

# This is a portfolio site for me that has:
## Working links between each page. 
## Accurate information in my about me page.
## A contact me page that I will later configure to be working contact me form.
## A basic layout for a portfolio page that just has placeholder images for right now.

# Note: I know that I do not have a picture of myself or any pictures in my portfolio page. The reason I dont have a picture of myself is because I dont take a lot of pictures of myself. Im not the biggest fan of having my picture taken in general but I will make sure that I have a professional picture to upload to this site in the near future because I also need to have a professional photo of me for all of my profile pictures anyways. The reason I did not have any screenshots of any of my work is because I honestly just havent taken any. If you read about our business in my About me page every year we get absolutley SLAMMED during Black Friday. I have been unnaturally busy the past couple of weeks and I just have had little to no free time... 
# Black Friday and work are also the reason that I am asking for a little bit of mercy that i am about a half hour late on this assignment... It would be greatly appreciated!
